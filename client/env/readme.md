Here’s how these different .env files are typically used:
## .env:
 This is the default global configuration. Variables in this file are loaded regardless of the environment. It’s ideal for variables that are common across all environments (like app name or version).

## .env.local: 
This file is intended for local machine overrides. It’s commonly used for sensitive information or machine-specific configurations (like API keys or database credentials). This file is usually added to .gitignore so it isn’t committed to version control. It’s loaded in all modes but takes precedence over .env.

## .env.development:
 This file is specific to the development environment. It’s loaded when the app is run in development mode (vite --mode development or simply vite if development is the default). You might include variables like VITE_API_BASE_URL for pointing to a staging server.

## .env.production: 
This file is specific to the production environment. It’s loaded when building or serving the app in production mode (vite --mode production). Use this file for variables like the production API endpoint.

###### How Vite Prioritizes .env Files
When you run Vite with a specific mode, it loads environment variables in this order:
	** 1.	.env (global defaults)**
	** 2.	.env.local (local overrides)**
	** 3.	.env.[mode] (environment-specific, e.g., .env.development or .env.production)**
	** 4.	.env.[mode].local (environment-specific local overrides)**

Each successive file can override variables from the previous ones. This prioritization gives you flexibility to manage shared settings and specific overrides.

## Explanation

	•	When you run npm run dev, Vite will use .env.development.
	•	Running npm run build will use .env.production.
	•	If you add npm run local, it will use .env.local.
