Understanding that **Cleaker** serves **as both** a **server** **and** **a** **unique digital asset identifier,** with a range of functionalities including context awareness, flexibility, and data signing, we integrated these features into the modular server design with **subdomain handling and profile routing**. The server will act as a **channel** for these functionalities over the network, specifically through :

https://cleaker.me and its user-specific subdomains like **username.cleaker.me**

# Subdomains
Subdomains are a way to create a **unique URL** for each user. This is done by creating a wildcard DNS record that points all subdomains to the same server. The server then parses the subdomain and uses it to identify the user. This is done by using the request object in the server, to get the subdomain and then using it to query the database for the user. If the user exists, the server will then route the request to the user's profile page. If the user does not exist, the server will route the request to the homepage.
