Cleaker: A Modular System for Decentralized Identities
Introduction
Cleaker is a decentralized framework designed to create and manage unique digital identities tied to modular attributes. By combining subdomain-based identity nodes, dynamic attribute systems, and semantic weighting algorithms, Cleaker offers a scalable, flexible, and future-proof solution for digital identity management and web3 interactions.

1. Identity Model
Subdomains as Nodes:

Each user is assigned a unique subdomain (e.g., username.cleaker.me), serving as an independent "node" in a decentralized network.
This subdomain functions as a user’s digital identity, enabling them to securely manage attributes, transactions, and connections across platforms.
Attributes as Dimensions:

Attributes are modular paths extending a subdomain (e.g., username.cleaker.me/music or username.cleaker.me/wallets).
They allow users to organize their identity into meaningful segments, adapting to personal, professional, or creative needs.
2. Semantic Weighting and Dynamic Connections
Cleaker integrates a semantic path-weighting algorithm to prioritize and contextualize interactions dynamically:

Frequency Weighting: Highlights frequently accessed attributes or connections.
Similarity Weighting: Uses conceptual proximity (e.g., synonyms) to relate attributes and users, creating a web of relevance.
Temporal Decay: Reduces the weight of older, less-relevant attributes, ensuring the system reflects current user interactions.
This algorithm enables Cleaker to deliver personalized, context-aware content while maintaining the flexibility to evolve with the user’s needs.

3. Subdomains as Crypto Wallet Managers
Cleaker extends its utility by linking crypto wallets to user identities, transforming subdomains into comprehensive web3 management tools:

Human-Readable Addresses: Users can send and receive crypto using username.cleaker.me, eliminating errors from long wallet addresses.
Multi-Wallet Support: Link multiple wallets (Ethereum, Bitcoin, NFTs) under a single identity.
Seamless dApp Integration: Cleaker acts as a bridge, allowing decentralized apps to interact with linked wallets through the subdomain.
This feature simplifies wallet management and accelerates adoption by providing a user-friendly entry point into web3 ecosystems.

4. Infrastructure
Wildcard Subdomains:

Cleaker uses wildcard DNS to route all subdomains to a central server. The server resolves each subdomain dynamically to the corresponding user.
Routing and Modular Attributes:

A subdomain (username.cleaker.me) maps directly to a user's profile.
Modular paths (/attributes) allow scalable expansion without impacting the core identity model.
Centralized and Decentralized Balance:

While identity management is decentralized, centralized elements (e.g., caching) optimize performance without compromising autonomy.
5. Use Cases
Cleaker unlocks a wide range of applications:

Personal Branding: Unique subdomains and attributes allow users to showcase their portfolios, projects, or creative works dynamically.
Crypto and NFT Management: Simplified wallet linking, peer-to-peer payments, and curated galleries for NFT ownership.
Collaboration: Attributes like /collaborations create dynamic connections between users with shared interests or projects.
Decentralized Identity: Cleaker subdomains can act as login credentials for web3 platforms, enhancing interoperability.
Why Cleaker Matters
Cleaker isn’t just a digital identity system—it’s a dynamic framework for interconnectedness. By unifying subdomains, modular attributes, and semantic weighting, Cleaker creates a decentralized yet organized ecosystem that adapts to user behavior and needs.

Conclusion
Cleaker is the bridge between decentralized identity and real-world utility. With its flexible architecture, it empowers users to own, organize, and connect their digital presence, paving the way for scalable, meaningful interactions in the web3 era.
